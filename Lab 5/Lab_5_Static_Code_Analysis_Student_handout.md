Lab 5: Static Code Analysis 
Objective 
To enhance Python code quality, security, and style by utilizing static analysis tools (Pylint, Bandit, 
and Flake8) to detect and rectify common programming issues in the python script assigned to you. 
Duration: 
60 minutes 
Software Requirements 
●​ Setup python virtual env 
○​ python3 -m venv venv  
○​ source venv/bin/activate 
●​ Install Pylint 
○​ pip install pylint 
●​ Install Bandit 
○​ pip install bandit 
●​ Install Flake8 
○​ pip install flake8 
●​ Download the Python script from the GitRepo assigned to you. 
Learning Outcomes 
By the end of this lab, you will be able to: 
●​ Understand the purpose and scope of static code analysis. 
●​ Identify and resolve common Python programming issues, including mutable default 
arguments, overly broad exceptions, and insecure coding patterns. 
●​ Effectively use Pylint, Bandit, and Flake8 to analyze Python code. 
●​ Interpret static analysis reports and apply fixes based on issue severity. 
●​ Reflect on the contribution of static analysis to overall code quality and maintainability. 
Introduction 
In modern software development, ensuring code quality, security, and maintainability is paramount. 
Static code analysis is a crucial technique that involves examining source code without executing it 
to find potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and style violations. This lab will guide you through using three 
industry-standard Python static analysis tools: 
●​ Pylint: Your "strict code reviewer" for code quality and logical errors. It flags issues like 
unused variables, poor practices, and potential design flaws. 
●​ Flake8: Your "grammar checker" for Python code, enforcing PEP 8 style guidelines. It 
combines checks for formatting, whitespace, line length, and syntax issues.
●​ Bandit: Your "app's security guard" for Python, identifying common security vulnerabilities. 
It detects dangerous functions and insecure coding patterns. 
Deliverables 
You will use Pylint, Bandit, and Flake8 to analyze a provided Python program. Your task is to identify, 
document, and fix a minimum of four issues found by these tools, prioritizing high and medium 
severity findings. Finally, you will reflect on your experience with static analysis. 
1.​ A cleaned and updated version with at least four issues fixed. 
2.​ A filled-out table documenting the identified issues and how they were addressed. 
3.​ Answers to reflection questions provided in the lab. 
Steps: 
Step 1:Inspect the Python File in the assigned repo: 
●​ Open the .py file in the repo. 
●​ Familiarize yourself with the code's structure and functionality. 
●​ Run the program from the terminal. 
o​
python  your_python_script.py 
 
Step 2: Run Static Analysis Tools 
Now that your environment is set up, run each analysis tool against the python script. The output 
will be redirected to text files for easier review. 
1.​ Run Pylint:    pylint your_python_script.py > pylint_report.txt 
2.​ Run Bandit:   bandit -r your_python_script.py > bandit_report.txt 
3.​ Run Flake8:    flake8 your_python_script.py > flake8_report.txt 
4.​ You should now see pylint_report.txt, bandit_report.txt, and flake8_report.txt in your file 
explorer.  
5.​ Open them to view the reports. 
 
Step 3: Identify and Document Issues 
Review the generated reports and cross-reference them with the common issues outlined for each 
tool. Use the provided table structure to document your findings. You may need to refer to the 
official documentation for Pylint, Bandit, and Flake8 if you need more context on specific error codes 
or warnings.

Step 4: Fix Issues (30 minutes) 
Based on your documented issues, begin fixing the problems in  your_python_script.py. 
1.​ Handle all the issues reported from Bandit. 
2.​ Get the score of Pylint above 9.5 after changes. 
3.​ Handle all the formatting issues raised by Flake8. 
4.​ Verify Fixes: After making changes, rerun the static analysis tools and check the new reports 
(pylint_report.txt, bandit_report.txt, flake8_report.txt) to confirm that the issues you've 
addressed no longer appear.  
5.​ Repeat this process until your fixes are verified. 
 
Deliverables: 
1.​ 3 Commits for changes you made for fixing the issues raised by three tools. 
2.​ pylint_report.txt, bandit_report.txt, flake8_report.txt  (before and after)
